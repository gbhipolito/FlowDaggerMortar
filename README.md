# FlowDaggerMortar
A simple app (w/ comments and logs) showing MVP pattern using Square's Flow, Dagger, and Mortar
 - though there's no explicit use of Dagger shown yet. We'll get there. Model's also coming soon...

Also planning on using Square's Butterknife to inject views from xml.
 
If you want the simplest version, running but does nothing, Checkout the first commits.

I just used Log.e to easily see the logs.

I place in package 'squaresupport' those classes that I think would be better if included in the libraries either as part of the API itself (e.g. Layout, HandlesBack) or as templates/defaults (e.g. SimpleScreenContainer, GsonParceler).

Most of the codes are just boilerplates. Of course you wouldn't appreciate all those boilerplates yet because the app is too simple. You'll appreciate them more in a much more complicated app.
Yes, you would be asking why not remove all those boilerplates and just make them work automagically.. I think that would make it more confusing and harder to read, should be balanced between boilerplate and magic.
Though I still hope they could improve on the boilerplates, via templates/defaults maybe?

That's all for now.



Thank you.
